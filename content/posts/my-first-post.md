"Neither Suphis the monarch of Egypt, nor Rameses II, nor the builders of
Nineveh, did greater work.  Engineers from every nation on Earth have studied
this wondrous electric road from Pasadena to the base of Mount Lowe and have
pronounced it one of the chief monuments reared by human hands." -- [Edgar L.
Larkin, 1901](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1901PA......9..359L/abstract).

In astronomical circles, the Mount Wilson Observatory commands a great deal of
historic reverence.  While much interesting work continues at the Observatory
today, the major claim to fame of the observatory is the 100-inch Hooker
telescope, which was the world's largest telescope from 1917 to 1949.  Edwin
Hubble used it from 1922 to 1923 to prove that the Andromeda Galaxy is in fact,
a separate galaxy from our own Milky Way.  While this had been already
understood by a number of other people (e.g., [Ã–pik
1922](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1922ApJ....55..406O)), Hubble's
method was based on an independent distance indicator: the Cepheids.

This story is not about the Mount Wilson Observatory.  This story is about the
Mount Lowe Observatory, which existed [about 7
