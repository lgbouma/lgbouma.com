_"Neither Suphis the monarch of Egypt, nor Rameses II, nor the builders of
Nineveh, did greater work.  Engineers from every nation on Earth have studied
this wondrous electric road from Pasadena to the base of Mount Lowe and have
pronounced it one of the chief monuments reared by human hands." -- [Edgar L.
Larkin, 1901](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1901PA......9..359L/abstract)._

**In astronomical circles**, the Mount Wilson Observatory commands a great deal
of reverence.  Historically, the observatory's main claim to fame is the 100-inch
Hooker telescope, which was the world's largest telescope from 1917 to 1949.
Edwin Hubble used it from 1922 to 1923 to show that the Andromeda Galaxy is
a separate galaxy from our own Milky Way.  While this had been already
understood by other people ([Ã–pik
1922](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1922ApJ....55..406O)), Hubble's
method was based on an independent distance indicator: the Cepheids.
This was an important step in clarifying our context
orbiting one star of billions, in one galaxy of billions, within our own lovely
segment of the observable universe.

This story is not about the Mount Wilson Observatory.  This story is about the
Mount Lowe Observatory, which existed about 7 miles east of its more famous
counterpart.  

The Mount Lowe Observatory no longer exists, and most astronomers have not
heard about it.  In its place today lies the old concrete base of the
equatorial mount, derelect train tracks, and the concrete foundation of an
80-person hotel.  These "[White City
Ruins](https://www.google.com/maps/place/White+City+Ruins/@34.2109791,-118.1226944,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2c2b1d6d825f3:0x8b19023d042d0724!8m2!3d34.2109791!4d-118.1205057?hl=en)"
are at the time of writing described on Google Maps as a 4.9 star tourist
attraction, based on 13 reviews.  Signage around the area describes the
ruins of a dance hall, tennis courts, and a casino.  In their place today, there are some nice
picnic tables.  The ground is covered in [deerweed](/images/deerweed.jpeg),
[brittlebush](/images/brittlebush.jpeg), and [dodder](/images/dodder.jpeg).  If
you drive north up Lake Avenue to the Cobb Estate Trailhead, it's about a three
mile hike to the ruins.

Why was there an observatory here?  Why was it next to
a hotel and casino?  What happened to the wondrous electric road?
Did any interesting astronomical work actually come out of the observatory?
And why is it all now a ruin?

Now, I am an astronomer, not a historian.  This story is
relatively well-documented, and
there is even a 501(c)(3) dedicated to preserving the history and artifacts of
the Mount Lowe Railway ([link](https://www.mountlowe.org/)).
In the following, I'll try my best to summarize what I see as the most
interesting facts for the curious lay-person.
My motivation is simple: I found the story amusing, and wanted to share it.

## Thaddeus Lowe

The story starts with [Thaddeus S. C.
Lowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddeus_S._C._Lowe).  One of Lowe's more
interesting titles over his career was "Chief Aeronaut of the Union Army".
This means that he flew air balloons during the first few years of the American
Civil War, gathered information about confederate troop movements, and
telegraphed his observations to his superiors.  Lowe's actual observations
presumably used binoculars and telescopes, one step in a long-running
collaboration between military reconaissance and optical engineers that dates
back at least to [Galileo and the Doge of
Venice](/images/Galileo_Doge_of_Venice.jpeg).  After the war, Lowe invented a
process for producing hydrogen gas by passing steam over carbonized coal.  The
hydrogen gas was useful for many things: gas-powered lighting, ballooning,
refrigeration, and for manufacturing ice.  Lowe commercialized along all the
aforementioned axes, and made a lot of money.

He moved to Pasadena in YEAR, and with PERSONX thought it would be fun to have
a hotel in the San Gabriels near Pasadena.
Los Angeles was pretty different in YYYY.
Hiking was in the middle of its "golden era". 
Projects like X, Y, and Z were turning profit.
The freeway system was at STAGE X (the 110 for example was [decades
away](https://www.arroyoseco.org/HAERASP.pdf) from instantiation).

## What have we learned?

* To name mountains after yourself, befriend map-makers.

* To discover interesting things from your observatory, do not open it to
tourists.

* If you build in the San Gabriels, be prepared to pay a premium for good fire
  insurance.
