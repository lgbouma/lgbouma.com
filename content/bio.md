[comment]: <>  (# bio)

I was born in Bethesda, MD, and grew up in the circumference of a hadron
collider in Switzerland, in a valley between the Jura and the Alps.

I graduated from the University of Southern California in 2015 with Bachelor's
degrees in physics and mathematics.  I began graduate work in physics at MIT
with [Josh Winn](https://scholar.princeton.edu/jwinn/home), and transferred to
Princeton to continue the same.  I completed my doctoral studies at Princeton's
Department of Astrophysical Sciences in 2021.  During graduate school, I
enjoyed fruitful collaboration with the [TESS science
team](https://tess.mit.edu/team/the-tess-science-team/), as well as the
architects and executors of the [HAT Exoplanet
Surveys](https://hatsurveys.org/).  

I am now a postdoctoral fellow at Caltech, and I reside in Pasadena, CA.
Hobbies of choice include puppy parenting, rock climbing, and the search for
the perfect espresso.
