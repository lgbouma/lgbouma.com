# Welcome!

Hi there!
My name is Luke Bouma, and you have found my research website.

I am currently a [51 Pegasi
b](https://www.hsfoundation.org/fellow/luke-bouma-ph-d-candidate/) postdoctoral
fellow at Caltech, in the Division of Physics, Math, and Astronomy. 

I am an astronomer and physicist, and my research contributions have
been in exoplanet, stellar, and galactic astrophysics.  I explore these
topics using either observations, computation, or theory, depending on the
requirements of any given problem.

Feel free to click around!

If you'd like to read more about my work, check out my [research
page](http://lgbouma.com/research/).  A full list of my publications is
[available
here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/uXPWdyI2RH2T-Sv0rcwUwA),
and an academic CV is [available here](/pdfs/LukeBouma_CV_Jul_2023.pdf).
