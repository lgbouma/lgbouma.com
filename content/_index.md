# Hi there!

My name is Luke Bouma, and you have found my research website.

I am an astronomer and physicist, and I am currently a [51 Pegasi
b](https://www.hsfoundation.org/fellow/luke-bouma-ph-d-candidate/) postdoctoral
fellow at Caltech in the Division of Physics, Math, and Astronomy. 

Most of my work focuses on exoplanets and stars.
The main goals of my research are to understand how planets form and evolve,
to determine how that evolution is connected to the stellar and galactic environment,
and to explore the properties of planets that may be capable of hosting life.

My tools of choice include space- and ground-based telescopes, shiny computers,
and cutting-edge code.
