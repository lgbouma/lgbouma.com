# Luke Bouma

Welcome!  I am a doctoral student in Princeton's Department of Astrophysical
Sciences. 

Most of my graduate research is in exoplanetary and stellar astrophysics.  My
research interests are in observing and understanding the formation, evolution,
and long-term fates of planetary systems.  One way I pursue these goals is with
the transit method.

Some recent projects have included:

* Creating and analyzing light curves of stars in open clusters and moving
  groups, using the
  [TESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite)
  full frame images. The aims are to find planets with known ages, and to
  enable studies in stellar astrophysics.

  [(planet candidates)](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/view_ctoi.php)
  [(vetting report description documents)](http://lgbouma.com/notes/)

* Discovering that the orbital period of the hot Jupiter WASP-4b appears to be
  shrinking. [(paper)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....157..217B/abstract).
  In a follow-up study, we found that the main cause of the observed period
  decrease is the Doppler effect induced on the host star by an outer brown dwarf
  or low mass stellar companion [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00637v1).

* Analytically exploring how unresolved binaries affect planet occurrence rates
  measured by transit surveys.
  [(paper)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..244B/abstract). 

* Analyzing the tidal evolution of hot Jupiters, and inferring how quickly
  friction in their host stars leads to their demise.
  [(paper)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..165P/abstract)

* Simulating possible TESS Extended Missions, to understand what we can and
  should do with this instrument.
