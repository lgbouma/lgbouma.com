# Hi there!

My name is Luke Bouma, and you have found my research website.

I am an astronomer and physicist, and I am currently a [51 Pegasi
b](https://www.hsfoundation.org/fellow/luke-bouma-ph-d-candidate/) postdoctoral
fellow at Caltech in the Division of Physics, Math, and Astronomy. 

Most of my work focuses on exoplanets and stars.  My current research
aims to empirically advance our understanding of exoplanet evolution, and
to contextualize that understanding against the backdrop of an evolving stellar
and galactic environment.  The long-term goal is to explore the properties of
planets that may be capable of hosting life.

My tools of choice include telescopes in space and on the ground, shiny
computers, and cutting-edge code.

If you'd like to learn more about my work, check out my [research
page](http://lgbouma.com/research/).  A full list of my publications is
[available
here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/uXPWdyI2RH2T-Sv0rcwUwA),
and an academic CV is [available here](/pdfs/LukeBouma_CV_Jul_2023.pdf).

that evolution is connected to the stellar and galactic environment, and to
