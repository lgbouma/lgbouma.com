# Hi there!

My name is Luke Bouma, and you have found my research website.

I am an astronomer and physicist, and I am currently a [51 Pegasi
b](https://www.hsfoundation.org/fellow/luke-bouma-ph-d-candidate/) postdoctoral
fellow at Caltech in the Division of Physics, Math, and Astronomy. 

I primarily work in exoplanetary and stellar astrophysics, and I use a mix of
space- and ground-based observatories to conduct my research.
I also spend much of my time programming, since the data that I analyze are
often at the petabyte scale.

The goals of my research are to understand how planets form and evolve,
to determine how that evolution is connected to the stellar and galactic environment,
and to explore the properties of planets that may be capable of hosting life.
