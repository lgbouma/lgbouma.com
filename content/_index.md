# Luke Bouma

Welcome!  I am a [51 Pegasi
b](https://www.hsfoundation.org/fellow/luke-bouma-ph-d-candidate/) postdoctoral
fellow at Caltech in the Division of Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy. 

Most of my research is in exoplanetary and stellar astrophysics.  I am
especially interested in understanding the births, lives, and
deaths of planetary systems.  I do this using telescopes in space and on the
ground.

Feel free to click around!
