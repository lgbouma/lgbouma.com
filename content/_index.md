# Luke Bouma

I am currently a doctoral student in Princeton's Department of Astrophysical
Sciences. 

Most of my graduate research has been in the flourishing field of exoplanetary
transits. In particular, I'm trying to understand the formation, evolution, and
long-term fates of planetary systems.

Some recent projects:

* Discovery that the hot Jupiter WASP-4b appears to have arrived early for the
  [TESS mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite).
  Its orbital period also appears to be shrinking.

* An analytic exploration of how unresolved binaries affect planet occurrence
  rates measured by transit surveys.
  [(link)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..244B/abstract). 

* Analysis of the tidal evolution of hot Jupiters, and inference of how
  quickly friction in their host stars leads to their demise.

* Simulations of possible TESS Extended Missions, to understand what we can and
  should do with this instrument.

I've recently also been working on a
[project](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/data/approved-programs/G011103.txt)
to make lightcurves for stars in open clusters and moving groups from the TESS
full frame images.
