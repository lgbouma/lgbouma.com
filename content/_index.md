# Luke Bouma

Welcome!  I'm currently a final year [doctoral
student](https://web.astro.princeton.edu/people/luke-bouma) in Princeton's
Department of Astrophysical Sciences.  I'll be starting as a [51 Pegasi b
fellow](https://www.hsfoundation.org/fellow/luke-bouma-ph-d-candidate/) at
Caltech in September, 2021.

Most of my research is in exoplanetary and stellar astrophysics.  I am
especially interested in observing and understanding the births, lives, and
deaths of planetary systems.  I do this using telescopes in space and on the
ground.
