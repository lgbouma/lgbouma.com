Welcome! My name is **Luke Bouma**, and you have found my research website.

I am an astronomer and physicist, and I am currently a Carnegie postdoctoral
fellow at the Observatories in Pasadena.

My main research topic is planets that orbit other stars â€” exoplanets.
Exoplanet science is in a golden age of discovery, fueled by ever-more
sensitive telescopes and ever-more clever data processing techniques.

I am especially interested in exoplanet origins and the star-planet connection.
What processes produced the exoplanets that we see today?  In what stellar and
galactic environments does exoplanet evolution unfold?  I tackle these
questions using a mix of observational and theoretical tools, many of which are
focused on baby planets hundreds of times younger than the Earth.
