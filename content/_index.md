# Luke Bouma

Welcome!  I am a doctoral student in Princeton's Department of Astrophysical
Sciences.

Most of my research is in exoplanetary and stellar astrophysics.  I am
especially interested in observing and understanding the births, lives, and
deaths of planetary systems.  I do this using telescopes in space and on the
ground.
