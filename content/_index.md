Welcome! My name is **Luke Bouma**, and you have found my research website.

I am an astronomer and physicist, and I am currently a [51 Pegasi
b](https://www.hsfoundation.org/fellow/luke-bouma-ph-d-candidate/) postdoctoral
fellow at Caltech. 

My main research topic is planets that orbit other stars â€” exoplanets.
Exoplanet science is going through a golden age of discovery, fueled by 
a combination of ever-more sensitive telescopes and ever-more clever data
processing techniques.
I am especially interested in the issue of exoplanet origins.  What processes
produced the exoplanets that we see today?
In what stellar and galactic environments does exoplanet evolution unfold?
I work to answer these questions using a mix of observational and theoretical
tools, many of which are focused on baby planets hundreds of times
younger than the Earth.

[comment]: <> (  Most of my work focuses on exoplanets and stars. The main goals of
my research are to understand how planets form and evolve, to determine how
that evolution is connected to the stellar and galactic environment, and to
explore the properties of planets that may be capable of hosting life. )
