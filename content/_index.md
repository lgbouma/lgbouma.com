I am currently a doctoral student in Princeton's Department of Astrophysical
Sciences. 

Most of my graduate research is in exoplanetary and stellar astrophysics.  My
main research interests are in observing and understanding the formation,
evolution, and long-term fates of planetary systems. One way I pursue these
goals is with the [transit
method](http://www.iac.es/proyecto/tep/transitmet.html).

Some recent projects have included:

* Creating light curves of stars in open clusters and moving groups from the
  TESS full frame images. The first data release covers about one sixth of the
  galactic plane.  (paper, data products).

* Discovering that the hot Jupiter WASP-4b appears to have arrived early for the
  [TESS mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite).
  Its orbital period also appears to be shrinking.
  [(paper)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....157..217B/abstract). 

* Analytically exploring how unresolved binaries affect planet occurrence rates
  measured by transit surveys.
  [(paper)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..244B/abstract). 

* Analyzing the tidal evolution of hot Jupiters, and inferring how quickly
  friction in their host stars leads to their demise.
  [(paper)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..165P/abstract)

* Simulating possible TESS Extended Missions, to understand what we can and
  should do with this instrument.
