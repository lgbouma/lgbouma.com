# Luke Bouma

Welcome!  I am a doctoral student in Princeton's Department of Astrophysical
Sciences. 

Most of my graduate research is in exoplanetary and stellar astrophysics.  My
research interests are in observing and understanding the formation, evolution,
and long-term fates of planetary systems.  I often pursue these goals using
ground and space-based telescopes.

Some recent projects have included:

* Creating and analyzing light curves of stars in open clusters and moving
  groups, using the
  [TESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite)
  full frame images. The aims are to find planets with known ages, and to
  enable studies in stellar astrophysics.

  [(planet candidates)](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/view_ctoi.php)
  [(vetting report description documents)](http://lgbouma.com/notes/)

* Combining TESS and Gaia to show that a possible 10-million year old planet is
  something quite different. The manuscript is entitled:
  [PTFO 8-8695: Two Stars, Two Signals, No Planet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10253).

* Discovering that the orbital period of the hot Jupiter WASP-4b appears to be
  shrinking. [(paper)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....157..217B/abstract).
  We later found that the main cause of the apparent period decrease is the
  Doppler effect caused by an outer brown dwarf or low mass star.
  One in three hot Jupiters are expected to eventually show similar
  period changes.
  [(paper)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893L..29B/abstract).

* Analytically exploring how unresolved binaries affect planet occurrence rates
  measured by transit surveys.
  [(paper)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..244B/abstract). 

* Analyzing the tidal evolution of hot Jupiters, and inferring how quickly
  friction in their host stars leads to their demise.
  [(paper)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..165P/abstract)

* Simulating possible TESS Extended Missions, to understand what we can and
  should do with this instrument.
