#### NGC 2516 (CDIPS-III, Bouma+21) Supplementary Data

_2021.07.02_.
For most purposes, Table 1 of the paper contains everything you need. The
reports and light curves below are a supplement that can help manually resolve
period ambiguities. Additional information (_e.g._, spectroscopy, Gaia
astrometry) can also be helpful when deciding how to interpret a periodogram
peak.
