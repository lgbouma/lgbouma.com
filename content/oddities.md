Saturn. The [Cassini
Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#Cassini_Division) is
visible, and is caused by a 2:1 resonance with Mimas.  I took the images
through the 12" Meade LX200 in [Peyton's
Observatory](http://www.astro.princeton.edu/observatory/index.php), using a
Canon EOS 60D.  August, 2017.

[comment]: <>  (For image acquisition, I used EOS MovRec v0.3.3 (through a virtual machine), recording in video with half-second exposures at 500 ISO. I took about 5 minutes of video, which I then ran through Registax 6 and clipped to the best ~10% of exposures after alignment. I then stacked, ran a wavelet transform, and cropped, yielding the image you see with your two eyes.)
