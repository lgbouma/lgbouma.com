### Young Planets in Star Clusters

While thousands of exoplanets are known, most are billions of years old.  I
have used
[TESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite),
[Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)), and
[Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_space_telescope) to find and
study planets around stars in clusters younger than one billion years.  The
properties of these young planets help clarify the processes that sculpted
present-day distributions of exoplanet sizes, atmospheres, and orbital
geometries.

### Ages of Field Stars

While stars in clusters yield gold-standard ages for a select set of planets,
age-dating methods applicable to field stars might let us study planet
evolution for a much larger sample of planets.  Rotation-based age
dating is one of the most promising methods to age-date FGK
stars on the main-sequence.

### Complex Periodic Variables

Complex periodic variables are young low-mass stars that show highly
structured and periodic optical light curves.  They seem to be
explained by clumps of circumstellar material that corotate with the
star for hundreds of stellar rotation cycles.   The origin of
this material is unknown.  These objects are deepening
our understanding of stellar physics, and helping to clarify the 
environments to which close-in exoplanets are subject early in their lives.

### Dissolving Star Clusters

Stars form in clusters when molecular clouds
[collapse](https://youtu.be/3z9ZKAkbMhY?t=5).  After the gas from the birth
cloud disperses, these clusters dissolve and gradually populate the galactic
disk.  Using many of the same tools that I use
to study exoplanets, I also study cluster dissolution.  The near-term goals are
to reconstruct the initial cluster configurations, and to understand the
processes that dictate the shapes, sizes, and orientations of these loosely
aggregated groups of stars.  A long-term goal is to understand whether we
might be able to identify and study stars in the Sun's birth cluster.

### Long-term Fates of Hot Jupiters

Tides are expected to cause hot Jupiters to inspiral into their stars and be
torn apart, but it is not clear how long this takes.  Beyond determining the
lifespan of hot Jupiters, the answer also has implications for whether the
Earth will be consumed by the Sun in the distant future.

### Design and Analysis of Transit Surveys

I'm broadly interested in the design, execution, and analysis of planet-hunting
surveys, particularly using the transit method.
