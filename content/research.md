# Young Stars and their Planets

While thousands of exoplanets are known, most orbit anonymous stars in the
Milky Way with ages between 1 and 10 billion years.  I have been using
[TESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite),
[Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)), and
[Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_space_telescope) to find and
characterize planets around stars in clusters younger than 1 billion years.
The stellar ensembles that these planets reside in enable precise
age measurements, which can help us map out how planets evolve.

# Dissolving Star Clusters

Most stars form in clusters, when molecular clouds collapse ([see this
video](https://youtu.be/3z9ZKAkbMhY?t=5)).
After the gas from the birth cloud disperses, most of the stars 
escape the cluster's gravitational pull, freeing them to gradually populate the
galactic disk.
Using many of the same tools that I use to study exoplanets, I
also study the cluster dissolution process.  The goals are to reconstruct
the initial cluster configurations, and to understand the processes
that dictate the shapes, sizes, and orientations of dissolving star clusters.

# Long-term Fates of Hot Jupiters

Tides are expected to cause hot Jupiters to inspiral into their stars and be
torn apart, but it is not clear how long this takes.  Beyond determining the
lifespan of hot Jupiters, the answer also has implications for whether the
Earth will be consumed by the Sun in the distant future.  Related

# Design and Analysis of Transit Surveys

I'm broadly interested in the design, execution, and analysis of planet-hunting
surveys, particularly using the transit method. Related studies include:
