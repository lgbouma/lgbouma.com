# Young Planets in Star Clusters

While thousands of exoplanets are known, most orbit anonymous stars in the
Milky Way with ages between 1 and 10 billion years.  I have been using
[TESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite),
[Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)), and
[Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_space_telescope) to find and
study planets around stars in clusters younger than 1 billion years.
The stellar ensembles that these planets reside in enable precise
age measurements, which helps us map out how planets evolve.

# Ages of Field Stars

While stars in clusters yield gold-standard ages for a select set of planets,
age-dating methods applicable to field stars might let us study planet
evolution across hundreds to even thousands of planets.  Rotation-based age dating (gyrochronology)
is one of the most promising methods to age-date FGK stars on the
main-sequence.  A recent study that addresses some previous issues in the
accuracy and precision of gyrochronology follows:

**The Empirical Limits of Gyrochronology**

# Complex Periodic Variables

The "complex periodic variables" are young and low-mass stars that show highly
structured and periodic optical light curves.  We believe that they are
explained by clumps of either gas or dust that are forced to corotate with the
star for hundreds of stellar rotation cycles.  Up to half of M dwarfs could go
through such an evolutionary phase.  The origin of the material is not yet
known.  Most M dwarfs are known to host small and close-in planets, and those
planets could be a possible source of dust.  Alternatively, the M dwarfs could
have strong stellar winds, which might be a source of gas.  I've recently
submitted a study that describes our current state of understanding:

of TESS**

# Dissolving Star Clusters

Stars form in clusters when molecular clouds collapse ([see this
video](https://youtu.be/3z9ZKAkbMhY?t=5)).
After the gas from the birth cloud disperses, most of the stars 
escape the cluster's gravitational pull and gradually populate the
galactic disk.
Using many of the same tools that I use to study exoplanets, I
also study cluster dissolution.  The near-term goals are to reconstruct
the initial cluster configurations, and to understand the processes
that dictate the shapes, sizes, and orientations of dissolving star clusters.
The long-term goal is to understand whether we might be able to identify and
study stars in the Sun's birth cluster.

# Long-term Fates of Hot Jupiters

Tides are expected to cause hot Jupiters to inspiral into their stars and be
torn apart, but it is not clear how long this takes.  Beyond determining the
lifespan of hot Jupiters, the answer also has implications for whether the
Earth will be consumed by the Sun in the distant future.  Related

surveys, particularly using the transit method. Related studies include:
