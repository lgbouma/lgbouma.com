### Young Transiting Planets
While thousands of exoplanets are known, most orbit field stars
with poorly measured ages between 1 and 10 billion years.  I have been using
[TESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite) to
find and characterize planets around stars in open clusters and moving groups
younger than 1 billion years.  Related articles include:

  Planet in IC 2602.

### Long-term Fates of Hot Jupiters
Tides are expected to cause hot Jupiters to inspiral into their stars and be
torn apart, but it is not clear how long this takes.  Beyond determining the
lifespan of hot Jupiters, the answer also has implications for whether the
Earth will be consumed by the Sun in the distant future.  Related

### Design and Analysis of Transit Surveys
I'm broadly interested in the design, execution, and analysis of planet-hunting
surveys, particularly using the transit method. Related studies include:

* Biases in Planet Occurrence Caused by Unresolved Binaries in Transit Surveys.
  ([Paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..244B/abstract)).

* Planet Detection Simulations for Several Possible TESS Extended Missions.
