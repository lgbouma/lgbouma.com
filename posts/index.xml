      <description>In recent correspondence with a science writer, I was asked a few questions about my work with Moira Jardine, A Plasma Torus Around a Young Low-Mass Star (link). I spent some time crafting my response and I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be worth sharing.
1) What is a plasma torus? I understand it is a doughnut-shaped structure of plasma, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to cite you.
A plasma torus is a ring of ionized gas held in place around a planet or star by its magnetic field.</description>
