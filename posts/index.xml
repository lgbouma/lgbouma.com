      <description>&amp;ldquo;Neither Suphis the monarch of Egypt, nor Rameses II, nor the builders of Nineveh, did greater work. Engineers from every nation on Earth have studied this wondrous electric road from Pasadena to the base of Mount Lowe and have pronounced it one of the chief monuments reared by human hands.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Edgar L. Larkin, 1901.
In astronomical circles, the Mount Wilson Observatory commands a great deal of reverence. Historically, the observatory&amp;rsquo;s main claim to fame is the 100-inch Hooker telescope, which was the world&amp;rsquo;s largest telescope from 1917 to 1949.</description>
