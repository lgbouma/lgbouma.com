      <description>In recent correspondence with a science writer, I was asked a few questions about my work with Moira Jardine, A Plasma Torus Around a Young Low-Mass Star (link). I spent some time crafting my response and I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be worth sharing.
1) What is a plasma torus? I understand it is a doughnut-shaped structure of plasma, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to cite you.
A plasma torus is a ring of ionized gas held in place around a planet or star by its magnetic field.</description>

      <description>I was born in Bethesda, MD, and grew up in the circumference of a hadron collider in Switzerland, in a valley between the Jura and the Alps.
I graduated from the University of Southern California in 2015 with Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degrees in physics and math. I completed my doctoral studies at Princeton&amp;rsquo;s Department of Astrophysical Sciences in 2021, advised by Josh Winn. I continued my research as a 51 Pegasi b fellow at Caltech from 2021 to 2024, and I currently work as a Carnegie Fellow at the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution for Science, also in Pasadena, California.</description>

      <description>bio Luke was born in Bethesda, MD. He grew up in the circumference of a hadron collider in Switzerland, in a valley between the Jura and the Alps.
He graduated from USC with Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degrees in physics and mathematics.
He began graduate work in physics at MIT with Josh Winn, and transferred to Princeton to continue the same.
Over graduate school, he has enjoyed fruitful collaboration with the TESS science team, as well as the architects and executors of the HAT Exoplanet Surveys.</description>

      <description>Young Transiting Planets A major component of my thesis is the Cluster Difference Imaging Photometric Survey. While thousands of exoplanets are known, most orbit field stars with poorly measured ages between 1 and 10 billion years. I have been using TESS to find planets around cluster stars in groups younger than 1 billion years. This paper introduces the project, and this preprint validates a 40 million year old planet. Light curves from Year 1 of TESS are available on MAST.</description>

      <description>Young Planets in Star Clusters While thousands of exoplanets are known, most are billions of years old. I have used TESS, Gaia, and Kepler to discover planets around stars in clusters younger than one billion years. The properties of these young planets help clarify the processes that sculpted present-day distributions of exoplanet sizes, atmospheres, and orbital geometries.
