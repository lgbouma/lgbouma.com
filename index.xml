      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
1 2 3  ▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png   should become
1 2 3 4  ▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png   Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Step 1. Install Hugo Goto hugo releases and download the appropriate version for your os and architecture.
Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.
More complete instructions are available at installing hugo
Step 2. Build the Docs Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site you are reading right now.
Follow the following steps:
 Clone the hugo repository Go into the repo Run hugo in server mode and build the docs Open your browser to http://localhost:1313  Corresponding pseudo commands:</description>

      <description>bio Luke was born in Bethesda, MD. He grew up in the circumference of a hadron collider in Switzerland, in a valley between the Jura and the Alps.
He graduated from USC with Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degrees in physics and mathematics.
He began graduate work in physics at MIT with Josh Winn, and transferred to Princeton to continue the same.
Over graduate school, he has enjoyed fruitful collaboration with the TESS science team, as well as the architects and executors of the HAT Exoplanet Surveys.</description>

      <description>Young Transiting Planets A major component of my thesis is the Cluster Difference Imaging Photometric Survey. While thousands of exoplanets are known, most orbit field stars with poorly measured ages between 1 and 10 billion years. I have been using TESS to find planets around cluster stars in groups younger than 1 billion years. This paper introduces the project, and this preprint validates a 40 million year old planet. Light curves from Year 1 of TESS are available on MAST.</description>

      <description>Clouds in Princeton
Me, about 30 minutes before TESS was shot into space on a Falcon 9.
Saturn. The Cassini Division is visible, and is caused by a 2:1 resonance with Mimas. I took the images through the 12&amp;rdquo; Meade LX200 in Peyton&amp;rsquo;s Observatory, using a Canon EOS 60D. For image acquisition, I used EOS MovRec v0.3.3 (through a virtual machine), recording in video with half-second exposures at 500 ISO. I took about 5 minutes of video, which I then ran through Registax 6 and clipped to the best ~10% of exposures after alignment.</description>

      <description>Young Transiting Planets While thousands of exoplanets are known, most orbit field stars with poorly measured ages between 1 and 10 billion years. I have been using TESS to find and characterize planets around stars in open clusters and moving groups younger than 1 billion years. Related articles include:
