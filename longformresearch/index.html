<h3 id="young-transiting-planets">Young Transiting Planets</h3>

<p>A major component of my thesis is the <em>Cluster Difference Imaging Photometric
Survey</em>.  While thousands of exoplanets are known, most orbit field stars
with poorly measured ages between 1 and 10 billion years.  I have been using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite">TESS</a> to
find planets around cluster stars in groups younger than 1 billion years.
This <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..245...13B/abstract">paper</a>
introduces the project, and this
<a href="https://github.com/lgbouma/timmy/blob/master/paper/ms.pdf">preprint</a> validates
a 40 million year old planet.  Light curves from Year 1 of TESS are available
<a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/cdips">on MAST</a>.  Planet candidates are
listed on <a href="https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/view_ctoi.php">ExoFOP</a>,
and related documentation is hosted <a href="http://lgbouma.com/notes/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Exploring the wild world of young planets and stars, I also recently found that a
widely studied 10-million year old candidate planet is something quite
different. The manuscript is entitled <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160...86B/abstract">PTFO 8-8695: Two Stars, Two Signals, No
Planet</a>.</p>

<h3 id="long-term-fates-of-hot-jupiters">Long-term Fates of Hot Jupiters</h3>

<p>Tides are expected to cause hot Jupiters to inspiral into their stars and be
torn apart, but it is not clear how long this takes.  Beyond determinining the
lifespan of hot Jupiters, the answer also has implications for whether the
Earth will be consumed by the Sun in 5 billion years.</p>

<p>In a hunt for hot Jupiters undergoing tidal inspiral, I
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....157..217B/abstract">discovered</a>
that the orbital period of the hot Jupiter WASP-4b appears to be shrinking.  I
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893L..29B/abstract">later found</a>
that the main cause of the apparent period decrease is the Doppler
effect caused by an outer brown dwarf or low mass star.  One in three hot
Jupiters are expected to eventually show similar period changes, and so this
effect will be significant consideration in long-term searches for tidal
orbital decay.</p>

<p>[comment]: &lt;&gt; (A separate significant effect related to the rate at which the inspiral occurs
was found by Kaloyan Penev in a
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..165P/abstract">study</a> that we
worked on together.)</p>

<p>[comment]: &lt;&gt; (In a <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..165P/abstract">related
study</a> led by
Kaloyan Penev, we analyzed the predicted tidal evolution of the known hot
Jupiter population under a particular tidal model.  We inferred that the rate
at which friction in the host star draws in the hot Jupiter likely decreases as
the hot Jupiter gets closer to the star, which could prove to be a significant
avenue towards enabling the hot Jupiter population&rsquo;s existence.)</p>

<h3 id="design-and-analysis-of-transit-surveys">Design and Analysis of Transit Surveys</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m broadly interested in the design, execution, and analysis of transit
surveys.
For instance, I&rsquo;ve
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..244B/abstract">analytically explored</a> how unresolved binaries affect planet occurrence rates
  measured by transit surveys.
Before TESS launched, I also simulated possible TESS Extended Missions, to
understand what we can and should do with this instrument
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170508891B/abstract">(paper</a>, <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/jwinn/extended-mission-simulations">data
products)</a>.</p>

<p>[comment]: &lt;&gt; (Some of these considerations contributed to the team&rsquo;s plan to survey the
ecliptic in late 2021.)</p>
